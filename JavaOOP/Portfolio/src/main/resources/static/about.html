			<h1>About Me</h1>
		</div>
		<p>I have been around computers most of my life. I started with a Commodore64 and monochrome displays. I started with a 286 IBM and moved up through the ranks
			to a 386, 486 and my first Pentium was a 100mhz. I have contintued to build and upgrade computers throughout my life. Currently I have a liquid cooled, 4.0ghz Intel PC with an 
			AMD 390x graphics card. I primarily use my computer for gaming, but will occasionally edit photos and videos. </p>
		<p>I started learning coding when I would play older games and would have to alter the code to make them work on my system. This led to me exploring code and trying to understand how changing things
			would affect the final product. I have often dabbled in learning various languages from some of the free online sites and decided that it offers the challenge needed to make me appreciate my career.</p>
